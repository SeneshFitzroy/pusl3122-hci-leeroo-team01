## Abstract

Lee Roo is a production-grade, web-based furniture visualization and interior design platform. It enables professional designers and retail staff to collaborate with customers in real time, visualizing how selected furniture items integrate within room specifications—including dimensions, geometry, and colour palettes. The system combines **2D spatial layout** creation with **3D real-time rendering** to deliver an industrial-standard, Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) compliant user experience.

## Overview

The application addresses the furniture retail use case where in-store designers must:

- Capture customer room specifications (size, shape, colour scheme)
- Construct virtual room layouts with drag-and-drop furniture placement
- Render immersive 3D visualizations for realistic presentation
- Export designs for client review and archival

Core capabilities include **dynamic scaling**, **colour and shading** application, **multi-room** design support, and **export** to PNG, JPG, and PDF. The system is built for usability, performance, accessibility, and engagement in alignment with industry best practices.

## Testing

### Test Pyramid

| Type | Scope | Command | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Unit** | Lib, store, hooks | `npm run test:unit` | Isolated function and logic tests |

### Commands

```bash
npm run test          # Watch mode
npm run test:run      # All Vitest tests (unit + component + integration + a11y)
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests (lib, store, hooks)
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests
npm run test:a11y     # Accessibility tests
npm run test:coverage # With coverage report
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end system tests (Playwright)
npm run test:all      # Vitest + E2E
```

### User Testing

For formative and summative user studies, see [docs/USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md).

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous integration and deployment are implemented via GitHub Actions.

| Workflow | Trigger | Actions |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **CI** | Push, pull request to `main` / `master` | Lint, unit + integration + a11y tests, coverage, build, E2E system tests |
| **CD** | Push to `main` / `master` | Deploy to Vercel (when secrets configured) |

Pipeline definitions: `.github/workflows/`

**Path alias:** `@/` → `src/`. Build artifacts (`dist/`, `coverage/`, `test-results/`) are gitignored.

**Path alias:** `@/` maps to `src/` (e.g. `import X from '@/components/X'`).

## HCI Principles (Nielsen's 10 Heuristics)

1. Visibility of system status  
2. Match between system and real world  
3. User control and freedom  
4. Consistency and standards  
5. Error prevention  
6. Recognition rather than recall  
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use  
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design  
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  
10. Help and documentation  

---

## Accessibility

- Skip-to-main-content link  
- ARIA labels and roles on interactive elements  
- Full keyboard navigation  
- Focus-visible indicators (WCAG 2.1 AA)  
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support  
- `forced-colors` (high contrast) media query  
- Semantic HTML  
- Screen reader compatibility  

---

## Deployment

### Vercel

- SPA routing configured via `vercel.json`
- Connect repository for automatic deployments

### Firebase

1. **Authorized domains** — Add deployment domains under Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains  
2. **Google Cloud API** — Configure HTTP referrers for custom domains if using Google Sign-In
